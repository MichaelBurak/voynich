# _The Voynich Manuscript: A Modern Computer Vision Exploration_

## **_This README is a Work In Progress!_**

# Introduction: Motivation & Goals

- This project uses images from the Voynich Manuscript, a mysterious historical text containing botanical and other images as well as undeciphered text, to look for clusters and outlier images as well as to generally test Computer Vision techniques such as image similarity with SIFT.

- I chose this dataset after being fascinated by both the Voynich Manuscript and Computer Vision for years and deciding it would be a good playground to experiment with unsupervised(and eventually generative) techniques especially given the lack of 'ground truth' regarding anything about the manuscript.

# The Data Set

- Downloaded from https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2002046 if I'm not mistaken, all credit to the mysterious author(s?) and Yale, marked as Public access in the collection.
- Originally 214 images in a PDF converted to PNG/JPG with some trimmed for being garbage data (pictures of the spine of the book, Yale's metadata, etc...)

# Future Work

- I would love to explore various GAN architecture as well as the likely interesting results of pre-trained transfer learning classification models on the various images/parts of the images.
- Exploring what features are extracted by CNNs and visualizing them through layers is a big goal, to see how models latch onto the dataset.
- Further work with embeddings of different sorts would be interesting.
